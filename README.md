# Welcome to Leonid!

The idea is to provide a meteor-based infrastructure for doing in-browser games, with an
emphasis on the canvas and canvas-related frameworks.

It's also potentially the front-end for a larger encompassing framework (maybe talking to
a Ruby game server like Theseus.)

# Installation

Dependencies would include npm and node. Leonid is on meteor so you'll need that, too. To run the tests you'll also
need mocha. (And probably chai eventually.)

Run 'mocha' and make sure all the tests are passing.

Assuming all is well, 'meteor' should fire up the server.
